Arjun Mehra was raised in a household where honesty was the most important value. As a child, he once witnessed his father being punished for refusing to follow an unfair order in the army. This incident deeply influenced Arjun and taught him that personal integrity should always come before career success.

During his teenage years, Arjun became known in his school for standing up to bullies, even when it made him unpopular. Teachers often trusted him with responsibility because he was consistent and fair in his actions.

This early exposure to moral courage shaped Arjun into an adult who could not tolerate dishonesty or corruption. Whenever he faced difficult choices later in life, he remembered his father’s example and chose to act according to his conscience, no matter the consequences.
