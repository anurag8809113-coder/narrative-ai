Arjun Mehra grew up in the small town of Devgarh, where discipline and duty were valued above all else. His father, a retired army officer, believed that strength of character mattered more than comfort. From a young age, Arjun was taught to face problems directly instead of running from them.

When Arjun was eighteen, he left Devgarh to study engineering in Delhi. Life in the city was difficult at first, but he slowly adapted. He worked part-time jobs to support himself and rarely asked anyone for help. His friends often described him as dependable, though sometimes emotionally distant.

Years later, Arjun joined a private infrastructure firm. During a major bridge project, a serious design flaw was discovered. Fixing it would delay the project and cost the company millions. Many senior managers suggested hiding the issue, but Arjun refused to stay silent. He reported the flaw to higher authorities, even though he knew it could end his career.

The investigation that followed exposed corruption inside the company. Several executives were arrested. Arjun lost his job but earned the respect of many in the industry. Eventually, he was offered a role in a government safety board, where he worked to ensure that public projects met strict standards.

Despite professional success, Arjun kept his personal life simple. He never sought fame and avoided unnecessary attention. For him, doing the right thing mattered more than personal gain.
